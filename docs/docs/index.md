# Documentation of one command auto reconstruct species phylogenetic tree



## Introduction

In some filed combine species phylogenetic tree do some prediction are very important for instance,
protein-protein interactions and gene pathway members prediction. In this predicted construct a exact species phylogenetic tree
is necessary, but the process of constructing the tree species is very tedious.

We developing a command line software **Physpe**, which only one command line to construct species phylogenetic tree. User need to provide a txt files, witch contain species names only.
(the species names must be a abbreviation same with **KEGG database** organisms abbreviation), the **Physpe** auto reconstruct species phylogenetic tree.
